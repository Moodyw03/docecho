# DocEcho Celery Configuration

This branch contains documentation for the working Celery configuration in the DocEcho application.

## Overview

The application uses Celery with Redis for background task processing, which allows PDF processing tasks to be handled asynchronously.

For detailed setup instructions, see [CELERY_SETUP.md](CELERY_SETUP.md).
